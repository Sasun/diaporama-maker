# Viewer Section

The Viewer displays a preview of your slideshow.

The **Viewer** is only a preview. Its sizing is also quite **flexible [1]**.

If you want to see a fullscreen preview of the Web Slideshow, you can click on ![](imgs/external-link.png) that opens a dedicated web page. Note that this preview uses the Original Images (that can be costy if you have big images).

The [Export Panel](export.md) provides ways to Download the final result of your work and select different Image Qualities (that depending on your needs will optimize bandwidth and performance).

> **[1]**: Diaporama, by design, does not have any fixed size, it always scales to the requested viewport size and ratio is also always preserved.

## Play/Pause

The Viewer will always display the slideshow **frame** that corresponds to where the Timeline Cursor is.
By default, the Timeline Cursor just follows the **mouse position** when hovering the Timeline.
But you can also Play/Pause the Diaporama either by pressing **SPACE** or by clicking on ![](imgs/play.png).

> If there is a current selected Timeline Slide, the Cursor loops over it, otherwise it loops over the whole Timeline.
